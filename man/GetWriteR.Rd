\description{
Anyone wishing to make use of the WriteR application must have pandoc installed.

Users that do not have Python 2.7 and wxPython installed cannot use the WriteR application file as provided by the BrailleR package. An executable for Windows is available for separate download. In 2018, the WriteR script files were tested for use with Python3; initial testing was successful.

Downloaded files will be saved into the user's MyBrailleR folder.
