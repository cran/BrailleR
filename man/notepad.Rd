\description{
Many standard Windows tools can be opened from the Run dialogue, but this starts them in the standard locations, when R users may want them opened or saved in the current working directory.
}
\details{
If a file specified does not yet exist in the current folder, the standard notepad editor  asks the user if a new file is wanted.
