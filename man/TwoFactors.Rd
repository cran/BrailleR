\title{A convenience function for a two-way analysis}
\description{Prepares an analysis of a data set with one response and two predictors that are both factors. An interaction between the two factors is also allowed for. The function creates a number of graphs and tables relevant for the analysis.}
\usage{
TwoFactors(Response, Factor1, Factor2, HSD = TRUE, AlphaE = 0.05, 
   Data = NULL, Inter = FALSE, Filename = NULL, Folder = NULL, 
    VI = getOption("BrailleR.VI"), Latex = getOption("BrailleR.Latex"), 
    View = getOption("BrailleR.View"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{Response}{Name of the continuous response variable.}
  \item{Factor1, Factor2}{Name the two factors to be included.}
  \item{HSD}{Logical: Should Tukey's HSD be evaluated for the data?}
  \item{AlphaE}{The family-wise Type I error rate for Tukey's HSD calculations.}
  \item{Data}{Name the data.frame that includes the three variables of interest.}
  \item{Inter}{Logical: Should the interaction of hte two factors be included?}
  \item{Filename}{Name of the Rmarkdown and HTML files to be created. A default will be created that uses the names of the variables if this is left set to NULL.}
  \item{Folder}{Name of the folder to store graph and LaTeX files. A default will be created based on the name of the data.frame being used.}
  \item{VI}{Logical: Should the VI method for blind users be employed?}
  \item{Latex}{Logical: Should the tabulated sections be saved in LaTeX format?}
  \item{View}{Logical: Should the HTML file be opened for inspection?}
