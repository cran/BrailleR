\details{The History2Rmd function was intended for turning a short interactive R session into an Rmarkdown file. Lines of code are all separated into distinct code chunks in the Rmd file. the resulting file will need to be edited if commands have spanned more than one line. 

The R2Rmd function does try to limit the number of blank lines copied from the R script into the Rmarkdown file. The Rmd file may need som editing.
}
