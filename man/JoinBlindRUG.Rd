JoinBlindRUG()

\description{
The BlindRUG email list is a forum where we can discuss issues about using R as a blind person. List traffic is light. You can join and leave as you see fit.

\details{
You will get an email prepared in your selected email client. Just press send without editing that message at all. Pretty soon, the server will send you a message that you will need to reply to in order to finalise the subscription. Once you have joined the list you will be sent an initial welcome message.
