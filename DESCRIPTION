Description: Blind users do not have access to the graphical output from R
    without printing the content of graphics windows to an embosser of some kind. This
    is not as immediate as is required for efficient access to statistical output.
    The functions here are created so that blind people can make even better use
    of R. This includes the text descriptions of graphs, convenience functions
    to replace the functionality offered in many GUI front ends, and experimental
    functionality for optimising graphical content to prepare it for embossing as
    tactile images.
