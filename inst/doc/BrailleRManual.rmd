# The BrailleR package

## Introduction
This vignette briefly demonstrates the functions of the BrailleR package. It is far from complete as it is currently a work in progress file for testing various aspects of vignette creation using the knitr package.


## Histograms
The first and most commonly used example of the value of the BrailleR  package to a blind user is the creation of a histogram.


```{r hist, fig.cap="A histogram of 1000 random values from a normal distribution"}
x=rnorm(1000)
VI(hist(x))
```

The mean $\mu$ of this random sample is `r mean(x)` which of course should be near enough to zero.
