- ensured BRL options are of correct type on load of BrailleR.
- created functions to change paper size and braille font point size.- included options for paper size and embosser type

- fixed bug in the batch file that converted an Rmd file to html. Now uses knitr::knit2html instead of rmarkdown::render.
- altered startup so that explicit use of the packages is initiated
